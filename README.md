# pose_optimization_tensorflow
Implements pose optimization of a simple mesh object. It uses tensorflow. Two approaches: training a neural net and standard optimization

The implementation is based on example from: https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/graphics/blob/master/tensorflow_graphics/notebooks/6dof_alignment.ipynb
